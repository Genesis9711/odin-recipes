    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Tavern pizza</strong>, <em>the original Chicago-style pie</em>,
      has a super thin, crispy crust with almost no rise. The toppings used here
      are a great combo of spicy and sweet — the pickled pepperoni add a nice
      acidic balance to the pepperoni and cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customize to your liking. Using a rolling pin to fully flatten the edges
      of the crust is different from how you would normally shape a pizza crust
      but this helps keep it thin. Add red chile flakes and Parmesan to finish.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
      <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce, divided (such as Rao’s®)</li>
      <li>12 slices pepperoni, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 jalapeño pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a food processor and process
        until combined, about 3 seconds. With processor running, slowly pour
        cold water and oil through the food chute and process until dough forms
        a sticky ball that clears the sides of the bowl, 45 seconds to 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil a work surface and set dough ball on top; knead until
        smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into a tight ball and place in a
        large bowl greased with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow
        dough to rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 1 hour
        30 minutes to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a pizza stone
        on the lowest rack in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from oven; drizzle with hot honey and sprinkle with basil.</li>
    </ol>
